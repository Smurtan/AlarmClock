# Alarm Clock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
I present to you an innovative alarm clock application.

This alarm clock will delight its user every time it is opened. And also here you will be greeted by a friendly, beautiful interface that will not let you get bored.  

Interface Features:
- The application opens in a round window, without the standard windows buttons and frames;
- There is a close application button at the top;
- The current time is displayed below;
- Next is a list of installed alarms that can be scrolled through and the alarm bars will change size.;
- The moon or sun icon is displayed inside, depending on the time set on the alarm clock.;
- Next is the time at which the alarm clock will be played;
- There is a switch with a smiley face at the end of the bar, which displays the activity of the set alarm clock.;
- It is worth noting that active alarms are filled with a gradient, while off alarms are filled with a solid color.;
- At the bottom of the window there is a button for adding a new alarm clock;
- When you click on the alarm bar, the alarm editing window opens (the same window opens when adding);
- In the modal editing window, you can select the playback time, days of the week, and music that is downloaded from the PC file system.;

Depending on the time of day, you will see a different design of the application, which will bring variety and will not let you get bored quickly.
